# Solepurpose

This project is for a Grand Canyon University Research Project.

## Background

The Phoenix, Arizona police department is one of the few departments that does not possess a database for details and images of shoes, and their soles.

## Goal

This research group consists of multiple forensics students who have been creating a glossary of different shoe patterns and taking images.

I, the software student, was tasked with creating a database that would store the shoe details and images. Also, I was to create a website which would display and filter the shoes, as well as allow the addition of new shoes and images.

## Technology

The database uses MongoDB just because I wanted to use it for a little experience. The entirety of the applicaiton will be built using the Next.js framework.
